nightmare-window-manager
======================

# Important Note
This library will not be ready for use until [Nightmare #391](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare/issues/391) is completed.  For now, if this library is needed, use the [`electron-plugin` branch from my fork](https://github.com/rosshinkley/nightmare/tree/electron-plugin).

Add pre-load content filtering to your [Nightmare](http://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) scripts.

## Usage
Simply require the library: 

```js
require('nightmare-window-manager')
```
